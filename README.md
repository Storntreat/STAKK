This was a project for NRG hacks,  a hackathon that was a collaboration between Newmarket High School, Dr. G.W. Williams Secondary School, and Richmond Hill High School.

# Project Summary

STAKK is a web-based tool designed to empower teachers to build and manage comprehensive student profiles in order to better understand their class dynamics and tailor their instruction. By capturing each student’s unique learning style, progress, preferences, and challenges, STAKK gives educators a centralized way to track, reflect upon, and adapt their teaching strategies effectively.

**Key features**

A profile system where each student has a customizable record containing their learning strengths and areas for growth.

Insight into individual students’ preferred learning styles (e.g., visual, kinesthetic, verbal) so instructors can adjust methods accordingly.

A dashboard view of the class as a whole, enabling teachers to see trends, identify when multiple students are struggling with the same concept, and intervene proactively.

Structured prompts and data‐fields to encourage consistent tracking of sessions and reflections (so instructors don’t rely purely on memory).

Designed for easy use in settings where multiple instructors work with a variety of students (e.g., a learning centre model), helping maintain continuity of teaching even when instructors rotate.

**Why it matters**

In many multi-instructor contexts (for example at a math learning centre), students may become frustrated or disengaged when they feel judged or misunderstood because an instructor doesn’t align with their pace or style. STAKK addresses this by giving the instructor the tools to learn the student rather than expecting the student to fit the instructor. This fosters a more patient, personalized, and effective learning environment—leading to improved student motivation, better session outcomes, and a stronger instructor-student relationship.

**How it works (at a high level)**

A teacher creates or selects a student profile before or during a session.

The teacher records details about the student’s learning style, previous concepts covered, pain points, and session reflections.

As new lessons occur, the teacher references the profile and adapts their approach (for example: using more visuals for a visual learner, slowing the pace for someone who needs more time, breaking down concepts differently).

Over time, the teacher uses the accumulated data to note progress, identify patterns (both positive and negative), and modify future lessons accordingly.

The class-level view lets the teacher spot when many students struggle with the same concept—triggering a possible review session or alternative teaching strategy.
